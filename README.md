# FB-tCNN for SSVEP
Here are the codes of the tCNN and FB-tCNN in the paper "Filter Bank Convolutional Neural Network for Short Time-Window Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential Classification" (DOI: 10.1109/TNSRE.2021.3132162). We will work on the codes as soon as possible.
## What you need to do
1. Download the code.
2. Download the public dataset ï¼šhttps://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/5/giz002/5304369 .
3. Create a model folder to save the model.
4. Change the data and model folder paths in train and test files to your data and model folder paths.
